# JOKES API
## Description 
To solidify what we've read about mongoose commands and express, lets create a new express project from scratch called "Jokes."
The following wireframe is to show examples of routes (full URLs) and then the returned json.  You are NOT required to create a front end for this assignment.  Please use Postman to verify your routes and output.
You will need to include the following routes:

Route                 VERB     Description

/api/jokes           GET       get all jokes

/api/jokes           POST     create a new joke

/api/jokes/:_id   GET        return a single joke matching this _id

/api/jokes/:_id   PUT        update a single joke matching this _id

/api/jokes/:_id   DELETE  delete a single joke matching this _id
